				<h1>Shaphard focuses on championship</h1>
				<h4>June 10, 2008</h4>
				<p>In life, there are many people we meet and know who have changed our life for good or for bad. For U track star Chelsea Shapard, all it took was one man who saw the potential she had to become a great track athlete.</p>

<p>That man was David Yocum. Yocum was a family friend and the husband of Shapard’s high school soccer coach. Yocum came to Shapard and told her she could get a full scholarship for track if she trained with him. Shapard agreed, and track became her means to succeed.</p>

<p>“I really got into track after my junior year of high school,” Shapard said. “David Yocum really motivated me.”</p>

<p>As a result of Yocum’s hard work, Shapard will run in the 2008 NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships today in Des Moines, Iowa in an effort to win a medal in the 400-meter hurdles.</p>

<p>She hopes to build on her momentum after an impressive year during which she was ranked No. 9 in the country. Shapard took third place at the NCAA regional qualifier on May 31, which qualified her for the championships.</p>

<p>Despite her success, Shapard’s first love hasn’t always been track.</p>

<p>“I never considered running track in college,” Shapard said. “I loved soccer and skiing.”</p>

<p>Shapard and her family moved to Park City when Shapard was 4 years old.</p>

<p>“Moving from Texas to Park City was a new experience,” Shapard said. “The first time I saw snow, I played in it for hours. The snow makes me so happy.”</p>

<p>She capitalized on her love for the snow by skiing regularly at Park City Mountain Resort. Shapard even made the PCMR ski team which allowed her to train six days a week.</p>

<p>“It was great,” Shapard said. “I missed a lot of school.”</p>

<p>Shapard was also a soccer star, lettering four years for Park City High School. Southern Utah University offered her a partial soccer scholarship and the University of Arizona offered a partial soccer/track scholarship.</p>

<p>“I always felt I was going to play soccer in college,” Shapard said.</p>

<p>Shapard started her collegiate career at Weber State. She played one year of soccer after walking on the team, but was forced to redshirt. She also ran track for the Wildcats, but didn’t feel WSU offered the college experience she was looking for.</p>

<p>“It didn’t feel like a college,” Shapard said. “I like the atmosphere at the U much better. I don’t regret coming to the U.”</p>

<p>After college, Shapard hopes to run fast enough to be sponsored by a major shoe company such as Nike. Shapard also hopes to one day compete in the Olympic Summer Games.</p>

<p>“I think the Olympic time trial B-standard is within reach,” Shapard said.</p>

<p>The B-standard time, which she would need to obtain to qualify, is 57.08 in the 400 hurdles.</p>

<p>If running after college doesn’t work out, Shapard wants to be a sports anchor or work in the sports public relations field.</p>

<p>When not running track or playing soccer, Shapard helps with the PCMR 8- to 10-year-old ski racing team.</p>

<p>Shapard will be heading to Des Moines with fellow U field athlete, Josefin Berg, who competes in the hammer throw.</p>
