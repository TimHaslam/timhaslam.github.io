				<h1>Lacrosse breaks even over weekend</h1> 
				<h4>April 13, 2008</h4>
				<p>The No. 19 Utah (7-7) lacrosse team extended its winning streak to four games after beating UVSC (6-4) on Friday, 15-4, but ended it quickly after losing to No. 20 Lindenwood (10-5) on Sunday, 12-11.</p>
	
	<p>Utah was without starting attackmen, Matt Qualey, and starting defensemen Clint English for the UVSC game due to injury. The injuries didn’t affect Utah as the offense managed to score 15 goals and the defense held UVSC to only 4 goals.</p> 
	
	<p>Utah came out slow, but held most of the possession in the first quarter. Seven minutes into the game, Utah attackmen, Ryan Watts, scored to opening up the scoring. Two minutes later, Watts scored again, making the score 2-0. Utah continued to hold the ball and not allow UVSC to have good possessions.</p>
	
	<p>Utah scored two more goals in the first quarter, one by Watts and the other by Pat McIntyre, making the score 4-0.</p>
	
	<p>Utah started off the second quarter by having long possessions but didn’t manage to score until five minutes had passed. Attackmen Mike Calvert scored to give Utah a comfortable five goal lead. Seven minutes later, Calvert capitalized on a failed clear by UVSC. The UVSC goalie tried to pass the ball to a fleeting defenseman but the defensemen dropped it, Calvert scooped it up and took it straight to goal, shooting the ball past the goalie.</p> 
	
	<p>With less than two minutes left in the second quarter, UVSC midfielder Ryan Cantwell, scored to take the score to 6-1. </p>
	
	<p>Utah answered right back with another goal by McIntyre, giving Utah a 7-1 lead going into halftime. </p>
	
	<p>UVSC scored one goal in the third quarter while allowing Utah to score four goals. Taking an 11-2 lead into the fourth quarter, Utah played its second string. </p>
	
	<p>“The game played out exactly how we wanted it to,” said Utah head coach Rich Levi.</p>
	
	<p>Watts scored four goals to lead the team. Calvert and McIntyre had 3 goals and 1 assist each. Utah spread out the scoring with Pat Guinn, Adam Grow, Jon Owens, Jeff Ball and Kyle Brennan notching one goal each.</p>
	
	<p>Utah was hoping to carry momentum versus No. 20 Lindenwood, who lost to BYU, 13-6, on Friday, but failed to do so, allowing Lindenwood to score three goals in the first seven minutes of the game.</p>
	
	<p>With six minutes remaining in the first quarter, Watts notched a goal to make the score 1-3. Utah hoped to build momentum, but Lindenwood deflated Utah by scoring a goal one minute later. </p>
	
	<p>Enter Matt Qualey. After missing two games due to an injured thumb, Qualey came into the game and made an instant impact, scoring two goals within 30 seconds of each other, boosting Utah’s confidence. Utah added one more goal 12 seconds later to end the first quarter, 4-4. </p>
	
	<p>Qualey then scored three minutes into the second quarter, giving Utah its first lead of the game, 5-4. Utah midfielder Steve Glauser scored to give Utah a 6-4 lead with nine minutes remaining in the half. 
	Lindenwood didn’t give up as they went on a three goal scoring streak, retaking the lead, 6-7, however, they got two penalties which allowed Utah to score two man-up goals to end the half 8-7.</p>
	
	<p>Defense reigned in the third quarter as only three goals were scored in the third quarter, two by Lindenwood and one by Utah.</p>
	
	<p>The fourth quarter started tied at 9-9, but it didn’t last long as Lindenwood scored 30 seconds into the quarter on a man-up goal. Utah and Lindenwood traded goals throughout the quarter with Lindenwood scoring with 3:25 left to go two goals up, 13-11. </p>

	<p>Utah answered just 11 second later with a goal by Calvert, which was the last goal of the game. </p>
	
	<p>“We are disappointed,” said Levi.</p>
	
	<p>Utah will face the team down south on Thursday at Juan Diego High School in Draper, Utah. Face-off with be at 7 pm.</p>
