				<h1>RSL: Unity needed to beat D.C. United</h1> 
				<h4>April 10, 2008</h4>
				<p>Real Salt Lake (0-1-1, 1 pt.) continues its 2008 campaign on Saturday when they take on D.C. United (1-1-0, 3 pts.) at Rice-Eccles Stadium.</p>
	
	<p>RSL has fared well against D.C. United when playing at home, winning the last two home matches, 2-1. </p>
	
	<p>The first win in the 2007 season for RSL came against D.C. United when RSL managed to get a two goal lead when striker, Robbie Findley, in just his first game for RSL after being traded from the L.A. Galaxy, put two goals in the back of the net. D.C. United  didn’t give up as they tried to continue a seven game unbeaten streak alive. Striker, Luciano Emilio, scored in the 87th minute en route to becoming the MLS Golden Boot winner in 2007 with 20 goals. </p>
	
	<p>The second time these two teams met in 2007, the score was the same, but the winner was different. D.C. United beat RSL 2-1 at RFK Stadium, with goals by Emilio and Christian Gomez. RSL midfielder, Kyle Beckerman, notched a goal in the 32 minute. </p>
	
	<p>That was then, this is now. RSL has greatly improved their squad, even though the result don’t show it.</p> 
	
	<p>On Saturday versus Chivas USA, RSL constantly raided the penalty area with shots. Although their finishing woes continued, RSL managed to do something they rarely could in the past - score off a set piece. In the 56th minute, Chivas Sacha Kljestan fouled RSL midfielder, Carey Talley on the left side of the field, about 35 yards out. RSL piled bodies in front of the goal and Javier Morales sent a ball right into the thick of things where Scottish striker, Kenny Deuchar, elevated and drove it into the back of the net with his head. </p>
	
	<p>D.C. United will hope to rebound quickly after beating Pachuca CF 2-1 on Wednesday in the second leg of the CONCACAF Champions Cup. However, Pachuca managed to beat D.C. United 2-0 in the first leg, which was enough to advance to the final. </p>
	
	<p>In the first MLS game in 2008, D.C. United suffered a 2-0 loss to the Kansas City Wizards. D.C. United didn’t waste any time finding their winning ways as they beat Toronto FC 4-1 the following week. 
	D.C. United has a powerful, attacking squad, led by Emilio. Emilio has five shots on goal in 2008 in just two games. Midfielder Marcelo Gallardo, striker Jaime Moreno, and midfielder Fred will support Emilio in pressing forward, which will challenge the RSL back line. </p>
	
	<p>Gallardo is United’s “Designated Player,” meaning his salary doesn’t count towards the teams salary cap. Gallardo was signed in January 2008 and will be paid a salary of $1.87 million. Gallardo started his career with River Plate (Argentina) when he was 16 years old. Gallardo then went to Monoco (French Ligue 1) before again returning to River Plate. Gallardo missed France and went back to Paris Saint-Germain in 2007. After only one year with the club, Gallardo terminated his contract and signed with D.C. United. </p>
	
	<p>The midfield for D.C. United will be without Ben Olsen who recently had ankle surgery. Olsen has seen time with the U.S. National Team and served as the skipper for United when Moreno was away on national team duty.</p>
	
	<p>RSL will have to play together as a team in order to stop the United attack while play in the midfield could go either way.</p>
	
	<p>Kick-off will be at 7 p.m. at Rice-Eccles Stadium on Saturday. </p>
