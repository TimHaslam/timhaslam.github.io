				<h1>Golf: Puttin' Utes travel to Happy Valley</h1>
				<h4>April 17, 2008</h4>
				<p>The Puttin’ Utes are in action on Friday and Saturday at the 46th-annual PING Cougar Classic in Provo.</p>

<p>The tournament will be played at the Riverside Country Club.</p>

<p>In 2007, BYU won the tournament with a team score of 32-under-par. Utah took sixth in the tournament following great play by former Utah golfer Dustin Pimm and senior Steve Broker. Broker was 3-under for the tournament which was good enough to tie for 14th individually. Seniors Chris Gresh and Nic Larson were 7-over par and finished tied for 55thplace. Junior Chance Cota was 14-over and finished in 85th place.</p>

<p>Larson finished tied for fifth place in the recently played Cowboy Classic with a 5-under score for the tournament. Gresh finished tied for 12th, with a 3-under tournament.</p>

<p>Utah will be led by Larson, Gresh, Cota, Broker and Nick Carter. Freshmen Chase Hite and Derek Adams will also be with the team, but will compete as individuals.</p>

<p>The field for the Cougar Classic will feature numerous teams from the west including Air Force, Boise State, BYU, Idaho State, New Mexico, New Mexico State, Sacramento State, Saint Mary’s, Utah, Utah State, Utah Valley State College, Washington State, Weber State and Wyoming.</p>

<p>Utah sits in 91st place nationally, while Saint Mary’s is the only team ranked higher at No. 42. Saint Mary’s enters the tournament hitting 74.3 percent of fairways and 70.1 percent of greens in regulation.</p>

<p>Utah will hope to continue its top-five streak that began after finishing third at the Ron Moore Invitational on March 23. The Utes finished fifth at last week’s Cowboy Classic.</p>
