				<h1>Lacrosse eases past Utah State for two-game home stand</h1> 
				<h4>April 6, 2008</h4>
				<p>The Utah lacrosse team (6-6) beat Utah State (2-5) 14-7 Saturday to continue its unbeaten streak against the Aggies.</p>

<p>Utah was led by junior attackman Ryan Watts, who had three goals and two assists. Sophomore attackman Mike Calvert notched two goals and had two assists.</p>

<p>The Merrell brothers, Nick and Cory, played well — Nick had three assists and Cory had two goals. Seven other Utah players had one goal and two more had one assist in an all-around team effort.</p>

<p>Freshman goalie Andrew Martinelli had four saves and didn’t allow a goal before backup goalie Jeff Horne took his place.</p>

<p>Utah had an 8-0 lead at halftime before making way for the second string to play. Utah scored three goals in the third quarter and Utah State matched that tally with three goals of its own. The Aggies then outscored Utah 4-3 in the fourth period.</p>

<p>Utah will start a three-game home span to end the season this Friday as it faces Utah Valley State College (6-3), which competes in Division II. Utah will then play No. 14 Lindenwood (9-3) on Sunday. Both games will be at Juan Diego High School in Draper.</p>
