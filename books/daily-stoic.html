				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Stoicism was a school of philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early third century BC. Its name is derived from the Greek stoa, meaning porch, because that's where Zeno first taught his students. <em>The philosophy asserts that virtue (meaning, chiefly, the four cardinal virtues of self control, courage, justice, and wisdom) is happiness, and it's perceptions of things - rather that the things themselves - that cause most of our trouble.</em> Stoicism teaches that we can't control or rely on anything outside what Epictetus called our 'reasoned choice' - our ability to use our reason to choose how we categorize, respond, and reorient ourselves to external events.</li>

				<h4>January - Clarity</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>1/14 - Philosphy is simply asking us to pay careful attention and to strive to be more than a pawn. As Viktor Frankl puts it in <em>The Will to Meaning</em>, 'Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.' <u>These values and inner awareness prevent us from being puppets.</u> (TH: What are our values? How do we have inner awareness?)</li>
					<li>1/23 - That's what Seneca is reminding us. As somone who was one of the richest men in Rome, he knew firsthand that money only marginally changes life. It doesn't solve problems that people without it seem to think it will. In fact, no material possession will. External things can't fix internal issues.</li>
					<li>1/28 - "Take a good hard look at people's ruling principle, especially of the wise, what they run away from and what they seek out" - Marcus Aurelius. Seneca has said, "Without a ruler to do it against, you can't make crooked straight." Pick someone to be your straight edge, watch what they do and don't do and do your best to do the same.</li>
					<li>1/29 - Find clarity in the simplicity of doing your job today.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>February - Passions and Emotions</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>2/1 - Anger is not impressive or tough - it's a mistake. It's weakness. Strength is the ability to maintain a hold of oneself. Control your passions instead of being controlled by them.</li>	
					<li>2/6 - Theodore Roosevelt was a truly great man. But he was also driven by a compulsion, a work and activity addiction that was seemingly without end. Many of us share this affliction - being driven by something we can't control. We're affraid of being still, so we seek out strife and action as a distraction. We choose to be at war - in some cases, literally - when pease is in fact the more honorable and fitting choice. Yes, the man in the arena is admirable. As is the solider and the politician and the businesswoman and all the other occupations. But, and this is a big but, only if we're in the arena for the right reasons.</li>
