				<p>"Luck is like a bus," he (Qi Lu) told me. "If you miss one, there's always the next one. But if you're not prepared, you won't be able to jump on."</p>
				
				<h4>Page 114</h4>
				<p>"I worked for Warren Buffet for seven years," he said, "and out of everything he's taught me, this was his greatest piece of advice."</p>
				<p>I pulled a pen out of my pocket.</p>
				<p>"On the first sheet of paper," Dan said, "write a list of twenty-five things you want to accomplish in the next twelve months."</p>
				<p>I wrote things related to my family, health, working with Elliott, working on the mission, places I wanted to travel, and books I wanted to read.</p>
				<p>"If you could only do five of those things in the next three months," Dan said, "which would you choose?"</p>
				<p>I circled them. Dan told me to copy those five things onto the second sheet of paper, and then cross them off the first.</p>
				<p>"You now have two lists," he said. "On top of the list of five, write: 'The Priority List.'"</p>
				<p>I scribbled it accross.</p>
				<p>"All right," he said. "Now over the list of twenty, write: 'The Avoidance List.'"</p>
				<p>"Huh?"</p>
				<p>"That's Mr. Buffett's secret," Dan said. "The key to accomplishing your top five priorities is to avoid the other twenty."</p>
				<p>I looked at my list of five. Then at my list of twenty.</p>
				<p>"I see your point," I said. "But there are things on that Avoidance List that I really want to do."</p>
				<p>"You have a choice," Dan said. "You can be good at those twenty-five things or you can be world-class at the five. Most people have so many things they want to do that they never do a single thing well. If I've learned one thing from Mr. Buffet, it's that the Avoidance List is the secret to being world-class."</p>
				<p>"Success," he added, "is a result of prioritizing your desires."</p>
