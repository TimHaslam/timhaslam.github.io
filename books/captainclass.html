				<h4>Social Loafing</h4>
				<p>One of the first scientists to explore the dynamics of group effort was a French agricultural engineer named Maximilien Ringelmann. In 1913, Ringlemann conducted an experiment in which he asked his students to pull on a rope, both individually and in groups, while he measured the force they exerted. The conventional view was that people in a group would have more power collectively than they did alone - in other words, adding people to the pulling group would have a multiplying effect on the force.</p>
				<p>But the results showed something surprising. While the force applied did grow with every new person added, the average force applied by each person fell. Rather than amplifying the power of individuals, the act of pulling as a team caused each person to pull less hard than they had when pulling alone. Later researchers coined a name for this phenomenon. They called it social loafing.</p>
				<p>Since then, the experiment was rediscovered and psychologies set out to replicate it. In 1979, a group of scientists at Ohio State University asked their test subjects to shout at loud as they could and recorded the decibel levels they produced. Next the subjects were put in groups and asked to repeat the shouting. The results mirrored Ringelmann's: Each person's group shouts were up to 20 percent less loud than their individual ones. Time and again, researchers tried some variation of Ringelmann's rope test and got the same results. It was a fact of human nature. The less identifiable one person's effort is, the less effort they put in.</p>
				<p>To add a twist to the Ohio State experiment, researchers at Fordham University decided to look at whether one person giving a maximum effort could incite others to improve their performances. The scientists grouped their shouters in pairs and, before they began shouting, told them that their partner was a high-effort performer. In these situations, something interesting happened. The pairs screamed just as hard together as they had alone. The knowledge that a teammate was giving it their all was enough to prompt people to give more themselves.</p>
				<p>The experiment demonstrated that high effort, or just the perception of high effort, is transferrable. In other words, the Ringelmann effect can be counteracted. The antidote is the knowledge that someone else in the group is leaving nothing in reserve.</p>
				<p><em>TH Note: Is there spiritual loafing?</em></p>
				
				<hr />
				
				<p>In 2016, Bret Stephens wrote a column in the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal in which he described a conversation he'd had with his eleven-year-old son. The subject was the difference between fame and heroism. His son's point of view on the subject was that famous people depend on what other people think of them to be who they are. Heroes just care about whether they do everything right.</p>
				
				<hr />
				
				<p>After conducting interviews with dozens of soldiers, they formulated a simple equation to explain their findings: <strong>Leadership = P x M x D</strong>. Gal told me the first variable - P - stood for Potential, which he defined as a person's God-given leadership ability. This was a natural gift that couldn't be taught, he said, and would start to become evident in a person's behavior as early as kindergarten. But it also wasn't excessively rare; many members of an army unit might have these skills.</p>
				<p>To become a leader, however, a person with potential also needed to possess the next variable: M. "The prerequisite to be effective is motivation," he said. These two variables were something of a twin set. People who had leadership potential often had the motivation to fulfill the role. But it was the third variable in Gal's equation that caught my attention: D for development.</p>
				<p>Here, Gal believed, biology played no role. Any leadership candidate, no matter how gifted, had to make an effort to learn the ropes and to prove that they had the right qualities. "You have to earn your leadership over time, to prove that your charisma is used the right way and that it flows in a positive group-oriented direction." Leaders must learn how to become a "prism" through which the group's perceptions are filtered and to learn how to manipulate these emotions in a way that lifts others, rather than unsettling them by confirming their fears. "Take three guys and put them in exactly the same situation," Gal said. "One of them will view it as desperate and hopeless. One will appraise it as stressful but challenging. But the third one will view it as a fascinating opportunity for excitement." Gal believed that the ability to frame these kinds of situations in a positive light was partly a reflection of leader's personality but also a function of experience.</p>
				
				<hr />
				
				<p>Hackman's theory consisted of four principles: 1. Effective leaders know some things. 2. Effective leaders know how to do some things. 3. Effective leaders should be emotionally mature. 4. Effective leaders need a measure of personal courage.</p>
				
				<p>The 'strange' think about Hackman's four rules, as he put it, was what they <em>didn't</em> include. There was nothing in there about a person's personality, or values, or charisma. There was no mention whatsoever of their talent. Leading a team effectively wasn't a matter of skill and magnetism, it was ll tied up in the quotidian business of leadership. To Hackman, the chief trait of superior leaders wasn't what they were like but what they did on a daily basis.</p>
