				<p>One of the first scientists to explore the dynamics of group effort was a French agricultural engineer named Maximilien Ringelmann. In 1913, Ringlemann conducted an experiment in which he asked his students to pull on a rope, both individually and in groups, while he measured the force they exerted. The conventional view was that people in a group would have more power collectively than they did alone - in other words, adding people to the pulling group would have a multiplying effect on the force.</p>
				<p>But the results showed something surprising. While the force applied did grow with every new person added, the average force applied by each person fell. Rather than amplifying the power of individuals, the act of pulling as a team caused each person to pull less hard than they had when pulling alone. Later researchers coined a name for this phenomenon. They called it social loafing.</p>
				<p>Since then, the experiment was rediscovered and psychologies set out to replicate it. In 1979, a group of scientists at Ohio State University asked their test subjects to shout at loud as they could and recorded the decibel levels they produced. Next the subjects were put in groups and asked to repeat the shouting. The results mirrored Ringelmann's: Each person's group shouts were up to 20 percent less loud than their individual ones. Time and again, researchers tried some variation of Ringelmann's rope test and got the same results. It was a fact of human nature. The less identifiable one person's effort is, the less effort they put in.</p>
				<p>To add a twist to the Ohio State experiment, researchers at Fordham University decided to look at whether one person giving a maximum effort could incite others to improve their performances. The scientists grouped their shouters in pairs and, before they began shouting, told them that their partner was a high-effort performer. In these situations, something interesting happened. The pairs screamed just as hard together as they had alone. The knowledge that a teammate was giving it their all was enough to prompt people to give more themselves.</p>
				<p>The experiment demonstrated that high effort, or just the perception of high effort, is transferrable. In other words, the Ringelmann effect can be counteracted. The antidote is the knowledge that someone else in the group is leaving nothing in reserve.</p>
