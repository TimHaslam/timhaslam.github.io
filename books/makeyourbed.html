				<h4>Chapter 1</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.</li>
					<li>Making my bed correctly was not going to be an opportunity for praise. It was expected of me. It was my first task of the day, and doing it right was important. It demonstrated my discipline. It showed my attention to detail, and at the end of the day it would be a reminder that I had done something well, something to be proud of, no matter how small the task.</li>
					<li>Nothing can replace the strength and comfort of one's faith, but sometimes the simple act of making your bed can give you the lift you need to start your day and provide you the satisfaction to end it right.</li>

				<h4>Chapter 2</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If you want to change the world, find someone to help you paddle.</li>
					<li>The small rubber boat made us realize that no man could make it through training alone. No SEAL could make it through combat alone and by extension you needed people in your life to help you through the difficult times.</li>
					<li>I have never forgotten those people and I know that anything I achieved in my life was a result of others who have helped me along the way. None of us are immune from life's tragic moments. Like the small rubber boat we had in basic SEAL training, it takes a team of good people to get you to your destination in life. You cannot paddle the boat alone. Find someone to share your life with. Make as many friends as possible, and never forget that your success depends on others.</li>

				<h4>Chapter 3</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If you want to change the world, measure a person by the size of their heart.</li>
					<li>In 1969, Tommy Norris was almost booted out of SEAL training. They said he was too small, too thin, and not strong enough. But much like the young sailor in my class, Norris proved them all wrong and once again showed that it's not the size of your flippers that count, just the size of your heart.</li>

				<h4>Chapter 4</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If you want to change the world, get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.</li>
					<li>It is easy to blame your lot in life on some outside force, to stop trying because you believe fate is against you. It is easy to think that where you were raised, how your parents treated you, or what school you went to is all that determines your future. Nothing could be furhter from the truth. The common people and the great men and women are all defined by how they deal with life's unfairness: Helen Keller, Nelson Mandela, Stephen Hawking, Malala Yousafzai, and - Moki Martin.</li>
					<li>Sometimes no matter how hard you try, no matter how good you are, you still end up as a sugar cookie. Don't complain. Don't blame it on yor misfortune. Stand tall, look to the future, and drive on!</li>

			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h4>Chapter 6</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If you want to change the world, slide down the obstacle headfirst.</li>
					<li>Life is a struggle and the potential for failure is ever present, but those who live in fear of failure, or hardship, or embarrassment will never achieve their potential. Without pushing your limits, without occasionally sliding down the rope headfirst, without daring greatly, you will never know what is truly possible in your life.</li>

				<h4>Chapter 9</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If you want to change the world, start singing when you're up to your head in mud.</li>
					<li>We will all find ourselves neck deep in mud someday. That is the time to sing loudly, to smile broadly, to lift up those around you and give them hope that tomorrow will be a better day.</li>

			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h4>Chapter 10</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If you want to change the world, don't ever ring the bell.</li>
					<li>Life is full of difficult times. But someone out there always has it wrose than you do. If you fill your days with pity, sorrowful for the way you have been treated, bemoaning your lot in life, blaming your circumstances on someone or something else, then life will be long and hard. If, on the other hand, you refuse to give up on your dreams, stand tall and strong against the odds - then life will be what you make of it - and you can make it great. Never, ever, ring the bell!</li>
