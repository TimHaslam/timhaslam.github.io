					<li>Any fool can critize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. "A great man shows his greatness," said Carlyle, "by the way he treats little men."</li>
					<li>Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out whey they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticisum; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. "To know all is to forgive all." As Dr. Johnson said: "God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days." Why should you and I?</li>
					<li>The expression one wears on one's face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one's back.</li>
					<li>Professor James V. McConnell, a phychologist at the University of Michigan, expressed his feelings about a smile. "People who smile," he said, "tend to manage, teach, and sell more effectively, and to raise happier children. There's far more information in a smile than a frown. That's why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment."</li>
