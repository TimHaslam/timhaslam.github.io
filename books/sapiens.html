				<h4>Chapter 19 - And They Lived Happily Ever After</h4>
				<p>Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities re significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is particularly important. Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being, and between bad marriages and misery. This holds true irrespective of economic or even physical conditions and an impecunious invalid surrounded by a loving spouse, a devoted family, and a warm community may well feel better than an alienated billionaire, provided that the invalids poverty is not too severe and that his illness is not degenerative or painful.</p>
				<p>This raises the possibility that immense improvement in material conditions over the last two centuries was offset by the collapse of the family and the community. If so, that average person might well be no happier today than in the 1800s. Even the freedom we value so highly may be working against us. We can choose our spouses, friends, and neighbors, but they can choose to leave us. With the individual wielding unprecedented power to decided her own path in life, we find it ever harder to make commitments. We thus live in an increasingly lonely world of unraveling communities and families.</p>
