				<h3>2009 Westmisnter Preview</h3>
				<p>Entering their third season in the Men’s Collegiate Lacrosse Association, the Westminster Griffins will hope to continue to be a dominant force in Division II.</p>
				<p>In 2007, Westminster won the Rocky Mountain Lacrosse Conference Division II Championship and were beaten in the MCLA Division II semi-finals. In 2008, the Griffins defended their RMLC Division II title and also won the MCLA Division II Championship.</p>
				<p>I recently sat down with Westminster head coach Mason Goodhand, and associate head coach Dave Long, to get a preview of how the Griffins were going to continue their dominant play in 2009.
				<p>What is the key for the Griffins if they want to win the MCLA Division II Championship?</p>
				<p>“Getting the kids ready to play every game is the key. The young kids on the team can’t look at past results and our seniors need to step up,” Goodhand said. “We’ll take whoever has a good work ethic and turn them into lacrosse players. We give them confidence and confidence is what it takes to win championships.</p>
				<p>In 2008, Westminster had seven MCLA Division II All-Americans – three first-team, one second-team, one third-team and two honorable mention. Only two of these players will be back for the Griffins – sophomore goalie Dallas McLellan and senior defender Zach Kessler.</p>
				<p>“There are going to be freshman who get a significant amount of playing time this year,” Goodhand said.</p>
				<p>Is this year a rebuilding year?</p>
				<p>“I think every year is a rebuilding year until you get to year four or five,” Goodhand said. “It takes four or five years for a foundation to built where good recruits are brought in to replace outgoing players.”</p>
				<p>What game on your schedule are you looking forward to?</p>
				<p>“The next one,” Long said with a big smile on his face.</p>
				<p>“Good answer,” Goodhand said. “Our goal is to play better lacrosse every game.”</p>
				<p>Which three players stand out to you as players and people?</p>
				<p>“Lance Nielsen,” Goodhand said. “He played with me at the University of Utah then went on an LDS mission. He came back and joined the circus for a year. He now works in the mornings diving off cliffs in a local restaurant. Chase Reid also stands out. He lives in Ogden and travels 30 minutes or longer to come to school. He is recently married and will become a dad in August. He is here at every practice making the sacrifice. Then there is Chris Baer. He is from Philadelphia and came to Utah his senior year of high school. He played back east for a season and came back to Utah because it was a fun place to play.”</p>
				<p>The Griffins will begin their 2009 season on February 24 in Athens, Tennessee where they will face Davenport University.</p>

				<h3>1.8 Miles: No. 8 Westminster edges past No. 15 Fort Lewis</h3>
				<h5>March 30, 2009</h5>
				<p>The No. 8 Westminster Griffins beat conference rival No. 15 Fort Lewis by the score of 7-6 on Saturday at Dumke Field in Salt Lake City in what will surely be considered another dramatic chapter in these two teams history.</p>

				<p>The last time these two teams met was on May 3, 2008 in the final game of the Rocky Mountain Lacrosse Conference Division II Championship. In a seesaw game, Westminster held on to win by one goal 12-11 and won the RMLC Championship.</p>

				<p>Fort Lewis (1-4, 0-1) set the tone early after freshman attackmen Kevin Harkey backhanded a shot passed Westminster goalie Dallas McLellan into the back of the net after catching a pass off balance, giving the Skyhawks the early lead.</p>

				<p>Westminster (9-3, 3-0) answered with a goal just 36 second later. On the ensuing face off, Westminster got the ball and drove to the net, shooting a low ball past the Skyhawks goalie to take their first lead of the game. Neither team would score in the remainder of the first quarter after both defenses held tight.</p>

				<p>Fort Lewis tied the game at the 11:01 mark in the second quarter on a goal by junior midfielder Andy Grenhart. Both teams had long possessions midway through the second quarter. With 3:58 remaining in the second quarter, Westminster senior midfielder Danny Larkin caught a pass from twin brother and senior attackmen Ricky Larkin, and found the back of the net. The brothers celebrated by using their sticks to simulate guitars and pretended to play.</p>

				<p>With 47 seconds left in the first half, Grenhart scored again to tie the game at 3-3 at halftime.</p>

				The second half started with both teams having long possessions. Fort Lewis was able to capitalize five minutes in as Grenhart scored again to give Fort Lewis the lead. However, on the ensuing face off, Westinster got the ball, drove to the net and dumped to Ricky Larkin creeping around the crease who scored to tie the game. Ricky Larkin would score again five minutes later to give the Griffins a one goal lead at the end of the third quarter.</p>

				<p>Fort Lewis tied the game 21 seconds into the fourth quarter on a man-up play after Westminster attackmen Josh Condas was penalized for slashing. Westminster wouldn’t let the Skyhawks gain momentum though as sophomore midfielder Lance Nielsen won the ensuing face off, drove to the net and dumped to freshman attackmen Andy Lehr who scored to regain the one goal lead for the Griffins.</p>

				<p>Fort Lewis would equalize less than a minute later on another goal by Grenhart. Both teams had long possessions and as time worn on, the players and fans were getting anxious. Westminster finally scored with 1:17 left in the game. Freshman midfielder Kevin Gee wrapped around the crease on the right side and shot it past the Skyhawks goalie, scoring the game winning goal.</p>

				“It is not insignificant that a freshman scored the game winning goal,” said Westminster head coach Mason Goodhand. “We really don’t have any freshman on the team anymore, they are playing like upperclassmen. We scheduled our team to play fatigue because if we want to get to the national championship, we have to play fatigued and I think we won while fatigued today.”</p>

				<h3>No. 23 Utah thrashes Montana</h3>
				<h5>March 14, 2010</h5>
				<p>The University of Utah men’s lacrosse team faced off against Montana on Friday at the Spence Eccles Field House in Salt Lake City. No. 23 Utah (4-1) won by a 17 goal margin en route to a 25-8 final score.</p>

				<p>“We’re finally starting to gel,” said Utah Head Coach Craig Morris. “Our guys are finally getting to see the entire scheme of things and it’s fun to watch.”</p>

				<p>Utah scored within the first minute of the game off a man-up play after a Montana player got confused with the football lines painted on the field and was caught offsides. Two minutes later, Montana midfielder, Henry Bishop scored for the Grizzlies tying the score at 1-1. Utah then went on a 8 goal run before Montana scored with 50 seconds remaining in the first quarter.</p>

				<p>Montana scored first in the second quarter on a goal by Bishop. However, the Utes answered back just 13 second later on a rip by Junior attackman Mark Manning. Utah scored four and half minutes later on a short handed goal by Senior Mike Calvert. The Utes took a 14-6 lead into halftime. </p>

				<p>Utah scored 7 goals in the third quarter and didn’t allow the Grizzlies any goals. The best goal in quarter came when Freshman Patrick Hagan scooped up the ball off of a face-off and drove towards the goal, drawing a Montana defender. Hagan dished to Manning who then found attackman Zac Harris coming from behind who dumped the ball over the outstretched Montana goalie.</p>

				<p>Utah scored 4 goals while allowing 2 in the fourth quarter while capturing their fourth win of the season.</p>

				<p>The Utes were led by Manning who had a total of 8 points from 3 goals and 5 assists. Freshman attackman Tyler Kunz had 7 points from 5 goals and 2 assists. Harris had 5 goals while Calvert ended the night with 3 goals and 2 assists.</p>

				<p>“Mark [Manning] is a great player for us,” said Morris. “The game was able to come to him today because some of the other guys were stepping in and making plays. He’s making the guys around him better which is really a huge thing for us.”</p>

				<p>The Ute defense only allowed 8 goals and were led by Freshman goalie Alex Watanawekin who played for most of the game and had 4 saves. Backup goalie, Freshman Bill McEnerney, had 2 saves.</p>

				<p>“Our defense played well in settled situations.” said Morris. “I would have liked to seen us play a little cleaner in unsettled situations. I was really impressed with our ability to get the ball from the defensive to the offensive end.”</p>

				<p>The Utes will play in-state rival Westminster College on Wednesday at Westminster. The game will get underway at 4 pm.</p>

				<h3>No. 10 Westminster edges out overtime win against No. 3 Utah Valley</h3>
				<h5>March 14, 2010</h5>
				<p>The No. 10 Westminster Griffins beat No. 3 Utah Valley in a snowy thriller at Dumke Field in Salt Lake City on Saturday. The Griffins game-winning goal came 46 seconds into overtime, making the final score 9-8.</p>

				<p>Westminster attackmen Kellen Lynn scored the game-winning goal just days after joining the Griffins.</p>

				<p>“[Lynn] had some difficulties eligibility wise,” said Westminster Head Coach Mason Goodhand. “Our school has some pretty stringent academic rules beyond the MCLAs’ rules and he happened to get his act together and he happened to be the guy who scored the game-winning goal. It’s nice to see when success stories like that happen.”</p>

				<p>Westminster (5-2, 1-0) scored first on a goal by Sophomore attackmen Dallin Hall. Utah Valley (3-2, 0-1) then went on a three goal run to take a two goal lead with 4:38 remaining in the first quarter. However, Westminster won the ensuing face-off but the UVU defense quickly forced a turnover but was unable to clear the ball. Westminster attackmen Andrew Gordon capitalized on the unsettled situation by scooping up the loose ball and shooting it past UVU goalie Cory Heward.</p>

				<p>Westminster scored first in the second quarter on a goal by Hall. UVU answered four minutes later to regain the lead. Westminster tied the game with 2:36 remaining in the half on a goal by Josh Condas. Two minutes later, with only 38 seconds remaining in the half, Westminster midfielder Jake Arthur scored to give the Griffins a 5-4 lead going into halftime.</p>

				<p>After five minutes of good defensive stretches by both teams, Westminster finally broke through the UVU defense, giving them a two goal lead. A two goal lead wasn’t enough though as just 9 seconds later, Westminster midfielder Gian Sexsmith scooped up the ground ball off the face-off and drove to the goal and scored, extending the Griffin lead to 3 goals. UVU answered a minute later when a UVU defensemen cleared the ball to attackmen Cam Peterson, who was uncovered and quickly drew a slide which left open midfielder Shawn Carter who was streaking down the middle of the field. Carter caught the ball and shot it pass Westminster goalie Dallas McLellan. Westminster scored another goal in the third quarter to take a 3 goal lead going into the fourth quarter.</p>

				<p>Westminster failed to score in the fourth quarter while allowing UVU to score three goals and force overtime. UVU scored with 1:22 left in the game on an extra man goal by Chad Frost. UVU then won the ensuing face-off, got the ball into the offensive zone and called timeout. After the timeout, UVU worked the ball around a couple of times before Carter took the ball to the left side and drove past his defender, shooting and scoring the game-tying goal with just 38 seconds left remaining in the game.</p>

				<p>In overtime, Westminster won the face-off and got the ball into their offensive zone. After a shot that sailed wide, Westminster attackmen Andrew Gordon started with the ball in the back-right corner. When the whistle blew, Gordon streaked behind the cage making it to the left goal-line-extended before his defensemen checked the ball away. While the ball was down near the crease, Lynn scooped the ball into the top right corner of the goal, giving the Griffins the win. Lynn immediately removed his helmet and threw both hands in the air while his teammates chased him and eventually caught him, forming a big pile at midfield.</p>

				<p>“We’re going to have a rivalry with these guys no matter where we play and no matter what the conditions,” said Goodhand.</p>

				<p>Westminster will play in-state rival Utah on Wednesday at 4 p.m. at Dumke Field in Salt Lake City.</p>

				<h3>Utah conquers crosstown rival Westminster</h3>
				<h5>March 18, 2010</h5>
				<p>The No. 23 University of Utah men’s lacrosse team added another victory to their rivalry with Westminster College, beating the Griffins by the score of 15-8 at Dumke Field in Salt Lake City.</p>

				<p>Neither team scored in the first six minutes of the game while the offenses looked for openings and got a feel for the defensive sets being run by each team. At the 8:24 mark in the first quarter, Utah attackmen Mark Manning drove from the right side, shooting the ball past Westminster goalie Dallas McLellan to open the scoring. Both teams continued to play great defense until there were 42 seconds left in the quarter when Utah attackmen Zac Harris gave the Utes a two goal lead. Just 35 seconds later, Utah midfielder Mike Calvert scored on a man-up goal to give the Utes a 3 goal lead after the first quarter.</p>

				<p>Westminster (5-3,1-0), who is ranked No. 4 in the Division-II polls, netted their first goal at the 12:30 mark in the second quarter. Westminster was man-up which caused the Utah defense to get confused, allowing Griffin attackmen Josh Condas, who was left wide open on the left side of the crease, score an easy goal. Utah scored one more goal  before allowing Westminster to get two goals and end the half with the Utes leading, 4-3.</p>

				<p>Utah (5-1) scored the first goal of the second half when attackmen Josh Kunz started with the ball in the back left corner, ran behind the goal and wrapped around the right side of the crease and managed to find a gap to get the ball in the back of the net.</p>

				<p>A minute later, Westminster attackmen Kellen Lynn scored to bring the Griffins within one goal, but Utah went on a 7 goal streak to put the game out of reach. The Griffins and Utes traded back-to-back goals until Calvert scored the last goal of the game with 2:11 remaining, giving the Utes the win.</p>

				<p>Utah led in almost every stat category which doesn’t always tell the story, but it did in this game. The Utes had 52 shots, 47 ground balls, won 14 out of 24 face-offs and successfully cleared the ball 19 times out of 21 attempts. Westminster had only 23 shots, 27 ground balls, won 10 of 24 face-offs and successfully cleared 17 times out of 23 attempts.</p>

				<p>“Our ground ball skills and our handling the ball under pressure really gave them possessions they really didn’t earn,” said Westminster head coach Mason Goodhand. “All they did was run hard and put pressure on us and we folded.”</p>

				<p>Utah was led by Freshman attackmen Tyler Kunz who had 5 goals. Harris, another freshman, netted 2 goals and 1 assist. Freshman goalie Alex Watanawekin had 8 saves and allowed 8 goals.</p>

				<p>“Young kids, Zac Harris, Tyler Kunz, continue to produce for us,” said Utah head coach Craig Morris. “They’ve just worked really hard and are very coachable.”</p>

				<p>Westminster was led by Junior attackmen Josh Condas who had 3 goals and 1 assist.</p>

				<p>This was the fourth time the two schools, separated by only 1.8 miles, have met in the regular season. Utah now leads the series with 3 wins.</p>

				<p>Utah heads to Colorado to face the University of Colorado on March 22 and Colorado State on March 24. Westminster will play Montana State on March 27 at Dumke Field in Salt Lake City.</p>
