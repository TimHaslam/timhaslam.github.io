		<h4>Project Overview</h4>
		<p>The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated syndrome, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in a pressing need to screen individuals and populations. We are performing a head-to-head comparison of commercially available immunoassays (e.g. immunochromatographic strip tests (ICT) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA)), including an evaluation of performance by time from symptom onset. Our goal is to provide comprehensive real-world test performance data to inform the scientific and medical community, government organizations, and the general public.</p>

ICT testing is performed by >2 readers blinded to test result. Assays are assigned a qualitative result based off of package insert-derived cutoffs. Quantitative results are derived from optical density for EIA and reader assigned integer score (0-6) for ICT band intensity.</p>

Sensitivity and specificity data are also assessed for different intervals from symptom onset (0-5d, 6-10d, 11-15d, >16d).</p>
