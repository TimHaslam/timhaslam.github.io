     <p> Good morning brothers and sisters, my name is Tim Haslam and my wife Nikki and I live on Morningside with our 3 girls, Marley, Milly and Nancy. We’ve lived in the ward for about 2 and a half years.</p>
<p>I have this thing where if I hear certain key words, it triggers a song in my head. I think it’s a blessing, Nikki thinks it’s a curse. I’m sure others of you also do the same thing but when Brother Young and I were chatting about this talk last week and he said, the topic is ‘Peace, Be Still’, I couldn’t help but sing in my head... ​Master, the tempest is raging! The billows are tossing high!​ I apologize in advance if you too are now singing it in your head, but on the way home last week I couldn’t help but picture the scene of a tempest that is raging in the sea. I thought of episodes of Deadliest Catch or YouTube videos that show ships getting pounded by huge waves, but I get sea sick pretty easily so I curtailed those thoughts pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I then went and read the scripture that Brother Young gave me in Matthew 8: 23-27.</p>
<p>23 ¶ And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.<br/>
24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.<br/>
25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.<br/>
26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.<br/>
27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</p>
<p>Then I turned to the same story in Mark and Luke which are almost identical. I then found a chapter in Jesus the Christ that dives into the details of the parables. Elder Talmage gives us some of the back story prior to the tempest, when he says, “While the boat was being made ready, a certain scribe came to Jesus and said: “Master, I will follow theewhithersoever thou goest.” Prior to that time, few men belonging to the titled or ruling class had offered to openly ally themselves with Jesus”</p>
<p>I immediately had the question, ‘Am I an ally to Jesus?’ or ‘Do I openly align myself with Christ?’ I invite you to think about that for a moment. Think about something you did this past week that helped align yourself with Christ. Were we open about it? What is something you can do this coming week to align yourself with Christ? When we align with Christ we heed his invitation to come unto him and follow him.</p>
<p>I continued reading in Jesus the Christ where Elder Talmage talks about the preparation of the ships and how tired Christ was after a long day of teaching. He continues, “Meanwhile the storm increased in fury; the wind rendered the boat unmanageable; waves beat over the side; so much water was shipped that the vessel seemed about to founder. The disciples were terror-stricken; yet through it all Jesus rested peacefully.”</p>
<p>Let’s pause for a minute and think of who may have been on that boat. The first disciples Christ had invited to follow him were Peter and Andrew who were brothers and also fisherman. He then found James and John, also brothers, who were mending their fishing nets. So we know at least four of the people on the boat were fisherman. It’s possible more were familiar with the seas. With that said we don’t know if they knew a storm was approaching, but regardless, for experienced fishermen to be terror-stricken means that it was likely something they had never seen before. Perhaps it was their experience on the seas and pride in their craft that persuaded them to continue though they knew a storm was coming. I can hear them saying, “We’ve sailed these seas before we’ll be fine”, “I’ve flirted with disaster before”, “I’ve spent my whole life on these waters”. Can’t we say the same things in our own lives? Aren't there times we see a spiritual storm approaching and take it head on. Don’t we know our own weaknesses and temptations yet we flirt with them anyway?</p>
<p>Elder Talmage continues, “In their extremity of fear, the disciples awakened Him, crying out, according to the several independent accounts, “Master, Master, we perish”; “Lord, save us: we perish”; and, “Master, carest thou not that we perish?”</p>
<p>I dare say we all have cried out the same way the disciples did at one time or another in our lives. When we’ve done all we can do but yet still fall short have we not at some point asked where the Lord is?</p>
<p>You’ll recall Joseph Smith did while unjustly imprisoned in Liberty Jail. In Doctrine and Covenants 121, he plead with the Lord, “O God, Where art thou? How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries? Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?” - In his own words, Joseph Smith essentially asked, “Master, carest thou not that we perish?”</p>
<p>The Lord responded to Joseph Smith in a similar way to his disciples when he said, “My son, peace be unto thy soul.”</p>
<p>From the the Book of Mormon we read about when Nephi was on a boat and his brothers and family became complacent and prideful. Nephi said that he was fearful that the Lord was angry with them and that they would be swallowed up in the depths of the sea. You’ll recall that the Liahona ceased to work. In 1 Nephi 18, verse 13, Nephi says, “Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and terrible tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly lest they should be drowned in the sea.”</p>
<p>Only after the party repented and exercised faith did the Liahona begin to work again and the seas were stilled.</p>
<p>Elder Talmage continues, “They were abjectly frightened, and at least partly forgetful that there was with them One whose voice even death had to obey. Their terrified appeal was not wholly devoid of hope nor barren of faith: “Lord, save us” they cried. Calmly He replied to their piteous call, “Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?” Then He arose; and out through the darkness of that fearsome night, into the roaring wind, over the storm lashed sea, went the voice of the Lord as He “rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.” Turning to the disciples, He asked in tones of gentle yet unmistakable reproof: “Where is your faith?” and “How is it that ye have no faith?”</p>
<p>If I try to literally liken these verses to myself, one experience comes to mind. On our honeymoon, Nikki and I went on a cruise and one of the stops was Catalina Island. As we looked over the excursions, we decided on sea kayaking. You may recall that I get sea sickness pretty easily. We started strong but then the guide had us pause to teach us about the many uses of kelp and that’s when it hit and I felt as if I might perish right then and there. The rest of the story is foggy in my mind so you’ll have to ask Nikki about it. She didn’t calm the seas, but she did get us back to dry land safely.</p>
<p>Without literally experiencing a tempest at sea, I then thought of spiritual tempests were I felt I might perish. I’ll admit that there haven’t been many spiritual tempests in my life but there have been times of doubt and discomfort, shame and sorrow.</p>
<p>One such time came to a close just recently. For the last 36 pay periods at work, only 2 paychecks have come on time and for the correct amount. For 18 months, between partial payments and lapsed coverages, I’ve tried to stand up straight with my shoulders back with my head held high, but I won’t lie, October was one of the toughest months of my life. There were many days and nights where I felt the Lord just didn’t see what was happening and I felt that he had no interest in the wellbeing of the Haslam family. After several timelines and promises had been delayed, our patience paid off and there was finally a breakthrough. There is no doubt that the Lord tested my families faith and urged us to have peace and be still.</p>
<p>To recap and close, we must be humble and not let our pride send us into storms. We must have patience to withstand any tempest we may find ourselves in and we must answer the Saviors question and find our faith then exercise it. The path is straight and narrow. And we’ve been given a rod to hold onto. We must grab it and go so we can obtain eternal life with the Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I know that Joseph Smith is a true prophet just as I know that President Nelson is a true prophet. I know the Savior lives and and loves us even though we may not think he does. I know he will still our storms if we just have faith. I know that God lives and say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
