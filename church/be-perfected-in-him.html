				<p>Good morning Brothers and Sisters, for those who don’t know me, my name is Tim Haslam. My wife Nikki and I live on Morningside and have 2 little girls, Marley and Milly, and a surprise baby due to come next month.</p>

				<p>I was sitting on the couch two Saturdays ago watching Christmas Vacation when I asked myself, “Who wrote this wonderful movie.” I looked it up on IMDB and just as I was perusing the brilliance and work of John Hughes, my phone rang and it said ‘Bishop Larson’. To be clear, Bishop and I are friends, but we aren’t the type of friends that call each other on Saturday nights around 9pm. Nikki asked who it was and I said, ‘Bishop Larson’. She quickly replied, “I don’t know where my phone is and he’s probably looking for me.” The thoughts running through my head were vast, but Nikkis explanation for the call seemed to make the most sense. I answered the phone. “Tim, it’s Bishop Larson, I’m wondering if you could speak…” - My heart began to pound thinking that whoever was assigned to speak on Christmas Eve had just bailed and Bishop was looking for someone to fill the void. Luckily it was just for today and not Christmas. I was relieved and gladly obliged to the call to speak today. </p>

				<p>The third to last verse of the Book of Mormon, Moroni 10:32, begins, “Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him.” This verse has been used in one way or another over 100 times in General Conference talks. You may recall it being used most recently in Elder Hollands last conference address titled ‘Be Ye Therefore Perfect - Eventually.” The verse continues, “deny yourself of all ungodliness; and if you shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace, you may be perfect IN Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, you can in nowise deny the power of God.” </p>

				<p>The word ‘in’ as a preposition is defined as expressing motion with the result that something ends up within or surrounded by something else. If we use that definition and rephrase the verse, it reads, “Yea, come unto Christ, and be in motion to end up surrounded by Christ.” If we read it that way, I would venture to say we are all are headed in the right direction.</p> 

				<p>I’d like to use three quotes by the brethren to help us further understand this principle of being perfected in Him. </p> 

				<p>First, Elder Bednar suggests that the process of becoming perfect happens ‘line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. Small, steady, incremental spiritual improvements are the steps the Lord would have us take. Preparing to walk guiltless before God is one of the primary purposes of mortality and the pursuit of a lifetime; it does not result from sporadic spurts of intense spiritual activity.’ I believe the way to do this are the typical Sunday School answers. We must frequently take an honest inventory of how we are doing in regards to temple attendance, scripture study, prayer, fasting, etc. Once we have done that we can set goals and make plans to be better. </p>

				<p>I just finished a book by James Kerr, titled Legacy. It is the story of how the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team has been so successful on and off the field for the last several decades. Kerr breaks the book up into 15 principles that he took away from studying the All Blacks. A part that stood out to me dealt with perfection. Kerr states, “The All Blacks display an institutionalized system of continuous improvement, one that works on the super-structural level which Kerr describes as the 4 year Rugby World Cup cycle, the team level, and the individual level. It becomes about the sporting buzz-phrase ‘du jour’ – ‘the aggregation of marginal gains’ or ‘the drive to perfect every controllable detail in search of optimal performance’. If we tie this into the gospel, we must ask if we are continually improving in our ward family through callings, home and visiting teaching, and service to our neighbors? Are we continually improving in our individual family by being a better husband, wife, mother, father, child or sibling? Are we continually improving ourselves by doing the little things each day? Are we achieving marginal gains in our spiritual life en route to becoming the best person we can be? Notice how Kerr talks about the drive to perfect every controllable detail. Are we on the path to perfecting the things we can control?</p> 

				<p>I work with the University of Utah lacrosse team which affords me the opportunity to travel with the team and attend practices. Each practice has a time squared away for conditioning. The team will head to the sideline of the field and stand behind the line in anticipation of the coaches whistle. At the beginning of the season, it was common to see players toes on or over the line. I remember a time this fall when a player had his toe on the line and the coach asked him, “How can you expect to perfect in a game if you can’t be perfect in practice.” Having your toe behind the line is something you can control and something you can perfect. If Earth is our proving ground, our time to be tried and tested, is our toe on the line or is it behind the line? This could be applied to a variety of gospel principles and commandments. Is our toe behind the line in regards to the covenants we’ve made at baptism or in the temple?</p> 

				<p>The second quote comes from President Russell M. Nelson. He taught, ‘here in mortality, perfection is still pending.’ Now, there are things here on earth that we can be perfect in. A pitcher may throw a perfect game, a musician may play a song perfectly or a surgeon may perform a perfect surgery. We can also pay a perfect tithe, keep the Word of Wisdom perfectly and so on. As we do these things, we gain a deep sense of satisfaction, self worth and spiritual blessings. </p>

				<p>We typically think of perfection as living a sinless life and having clean thoughts, words and deeds 100 percent of the time, but in the original greek text, according to Elder Nelson, the word perfect was translated from ‘teleios’ which means complete. Teleios is an adjective derived from the noun ‘telos’, which means ‘end’. The infinitive form of the verb is ‘teleiono’, which means ‘to reach a distant end, to be fully developed, to consummate, or to finish.’ President Nelson clarifies, ‘the world does not imply freedom from error, it implies ‘achieving a distant object’. Perfection is not about right or wrong, but rather the journey to a complete end. </p> 

				<p>The path to perfection looks different for everyone but the end goal is the same; to be surrounded by Christ. Everyone has different hardships, sins, temptations, joys, times of excitement and times of sorrow, but the opportunity to be free from faults or defects, refined, complete or perfect is the same for everyone. We have all had troubles which help refine us. Each trial we overcome helps to remove imperfections and make us free from defect. It may be hard to see that as we go through the trial or even after the trial. Perhaps, years later, we are still trying to figure out why a trial came when it did. But as we continue to be bent, molded, refined, cracked, worn down, then rebuilt stronger, we become free from defect and closer toward being perfected in Christ.</p>

				<p>Just as a diamond is created by pressure and heat, so too are we perfected in Christ by having weight and pressure applied to our lives. Two examples come to mind in this regard. The first is the famous example Elder Bednar gave in the April 2014 General Conference where he talked about his friend who wanted a new truck. You’ll recall that this man ultimately purchased the truck and was anxious to put it to use. He decided that cutting firewood would be the best thing to do at the time so he drove into the mountains where he got stuck in the high snow. He put the truck into 4 wheel drive but the wheels just spun. After filling the back of the truck with wood, the truck was able to have enough traction, under pressure from the full bed of the truck, to become unstuck and move freely. Elder Bednar said, “Each of us also carries a load. Our individual load is comprised of demands and opportunities, obligations and privileges, afflictions and blessings, and options and constraints.” He then asks us to ponder, “Is the load I am carrying creating sufficient spiritual traction so I ultimately can return home to Heavenly Father?” We must have some sort of load in order to have the traction needed to complete our journey towards being surrounded by Christ. </p>

				<p>The other example comes from the book by Daniel James Brown titled ‘The Boys in the Boat’. The Boys in the Boat is a true story about an American rowing crew from the University of Washington and their quest for gold in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. At the beginning of each chapter, there is a quote by a man named George Pocock. Pocock was a famous racing shell builder. A racing shell is a sleek, hydrodynamic row boat with the intent to provide as little resistance from the water as possible while maintaining balance and speed. At one time, Pocock was so good at his craft that he was making all the shells for all the American university crews. One of the quotes from Pocock stood out to me when he said, “It is hard to make the boat go as fast you want to. The enemy, of course, is resistance of the water, as you have to displace the amount of water equal to the weight of men and equipment, but that very water is what supports you and that very enemy is your friend. So is life; the very problems you must overcome also support you and make you stronger in overcoming them.” </p>

				<p>When I look back at my own life, the times that I have been in the thick of the refiners fire have led to great growth both spiritually and temporally. In 2003 my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. For a care-free senior in high school, this was a derailment in my own path, but clearly a time for growth in Heavenly Fathers plan for me and my family.</p>

				<p>Like any man, we typically need a woman to point out things to us that we miss. So I asked Nikki some of the things that she thought I have learned from this experience. She pointed out that I learned what it meant to have real responsibility. When my dad was at work, I would take care of my mom. She had a thing for the Big Cherry candy and Jamba Juice. So each week I would bring her some of those and we would sit and talk about life. Becoming more responsible has helped me on my mission, in marriage, my career and in life.</p>

				<p>Another thing Nikki pointed out was that I learned to be generous and compassionate. After my moms first surgery, I came home from school to find a large box on our doorstep. It was full of food, treats and drinks from my a friend of my parents. There were several examples of generosity towards my family during this time. I saw firsthand how helping others through generosity can help lift them during tough times.</p>

				<p>Nikki also said that I learned how to become a great husband and father. I learned this from watching my dad as he took care of my mom. He was with my mom every step of the way. My mom didn’t go to a single chemo treatment, surgery or doctors appointment alone. My dad stayed by her side the whole time. After my mom passed away in 2012, my dad lived alone for a few years but was very lonely. He started to date again and found a woman named Kris. Kris’s husband passed away suddenly a few years earlier, so she too was looking for a companion. Kris and my dad were married and live in Farmington. Shortly after they were married, Kris was also diagnosed with breast cancer. I have no doubt that the Lord knew my dad was an awesome caretaker and knew Kris would need someone to take care of her so he put them together. Empathy was not my dads strong suit prior to these trials but now it is one of his best attributes. Pondering our trials and looking at how others have handled theirs can give us great strength to overcome more trials as they come.</p> 

				<p>The third quote comes from Elder Holland. In his usual loving tone, he states that ‘Our only hope for true perfection is in receiving it as a gift from heaven—we can’t “earn” it. If we persevere, then somewhere in eternity our refinement will be finished and complete.’ The gift Elder Holland mentions and the grace Moroni mentions is the power of the infinite Atonement. Only Christ is able to extend his perfection to us after we have properly repented of any sin or weakness. Elder Holland states later in the same talk, that in the Sermon on the Mount, when Christ exhorts us to “be perfect”, Christ intended it to be a tribute to who and what God the Eternal Father is and what we can achieve with Him in eternity.</p>

				<p>The journey to become complete with Christ isn’t one we tread alone. Our Heavenly Father has given us the tools, the testimonies, and talents to return to live with him again and be perfected in Christ. It’s up to us to use those gifts.</p> 

				<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
